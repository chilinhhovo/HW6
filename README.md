# HW6
 **Homework 6:**
 The assigment ***animals*** was about counting ***dogs*** and ***cats***. I now feel confident at counting and making charts comparing dogs and cats after a walk around the city. My hypothesis would be that the number of dogs would exceed the number of cats, and extra observation, _I have not seen a cat on a leash in NYC like the dogs around the city._ 

 The assigment ***billionaires*** was about seeing how rich people are around the world but especially in the US. ~~This makes me feel hopeful about my salary and job prospects after the masters degree.~~
