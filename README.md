# HW6
 **Homework 6** 
 The assigment __animals__ was about counting __dogs__ and __cats__. I now feel confident at counting and making charts comparing dogs and cats after a walk around the city. My hypothesis would be that the number of dogs would exceed the number of cats, and extra observation, I have not seen a cat on a leash in NYC like the dogs around the city. 

 The assigment __billionairs__ was about seeing how rich people are around the world but especially in the US. This makes me feel hopeful about my salary and job prospects after the masters degree.
